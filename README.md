## What is TypeScript?
 - Superset of JavaScript and developed by Microsoft
   - All the things that JavaScript can do. Which inherits from JavaScript
 - Compiles to plain JavaScript
 - Easily Integrated into JS projects
 - Designed for development of large applications

## What Does TypeScript Offer?
 - [1] Static Type Checking 
   - Specifying type etc...
 - [2] Class Based Objects
 - [3] Modularity
 - [4] ES6 Features
 - [5] Syntax closer to Java and another high level languages

## Static Type Checking
 > With TypeScript we can check and assign variable, parameter and function types.
 - It is completely optional
 - Helps us to find and prevent bugs and stop future issues from happening
 - Make our code much more readable and descriptive
   - Especially, when sharing code with others

## TypeScript Types
 - String 
 - Number
 - Boolean
 - Array
 ---
 - Any
 - Void
   - No type returned
 - Null
   - undefined
 - Tuple
   - Array with fixed number of elements
 - Enum 
   - Enumerated numbers
 - Generics
   - Specifying type of string
   - Great for reusable code

## Class Based Objects 
 - Object Orientated Programming in JS
 - No prototypes
 - Encapsulation
 - Inhertince
 - Modifiers /public, protected, private/

## TypeScript Compiler (tsc)
 - Written in TypeScript itself
 - Compiles .ts files to .js
 - Installed as an NPM package (Node.js)
 - Supports ES6 syntax
